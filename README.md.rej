 Prefect tasks and subflows for interacting with Slack
 
-## Getting Started
 
-### Python setup
+<!--- ### Add a real-world example of how to use this Collection here
 
-Requires an installation of Python 3.7+.
+Offer some motivation on why this helps.
 
-We recommend using a Python virtual environment manager such as pipenv, conda or virtualenv.
+After installing `prefect-slack` and [saving the credentials](#saving-credentials-to-block), you can easily use it within your flows to help you achieve the aforementioned benefits!
 
-These tasks are designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the [Prefect documentation](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/).

+<!--- ### Saving credentials to block
 
 Note, to use the `load` method on Blocks, you must already have a block document [saved through code](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/concepts/blocks/#saving-blocks) or [saved through the UI](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/).
 
-### Write and run a flow
+Below is a walkthrough on saving block documents through code.
+
+1. Head over to <SERVICE_URL>.
+2. Login to your <SERVICE> account.
+3. Click "+ Create new secret key".
+4. Copy the generated API key.
+5. Create a short script, replacing the placeholders (or do so in the UI).
 
 ```python
-from prefect import flow
-from prefect_slack.tasks import (
-    goodbye_prefect_slack,
-    hello_prefect_slack,
-)
-
-# Use `with_options` to customize options on any existing task or flow:
-
-custom_goodbye_prefect_slack = goodbye_prefect_slack.with_options(
-    name="My custom task name",
-    retries=2,
-    retry_delay_seconds=10,
-)
-
-@flow
-def example_flow():
-    hello_prefect_slack
-    custom_goodbye_prefect_slack
-
-example_flow()
+from prefect_slack import Block
+Block(api_key="API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER").save("BLOCK_NAME_PLACEHOLDER")
 ```

+Congrats! You can now easily load the saved block, which holds your credentials:
